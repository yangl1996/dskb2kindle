# dskb2kindle

A command line tool that grabs an issue of Dushikuaibao (a local paper of Hangzhou, China) and converts it into Kindle format.

This project borrowed a bunch of ideas from [danchoi](https://github.com/danchoi)'s [kindlerb](https://github.com/danchoi/kindlerb) and [mhl](https://github.com/mhl)'s [guardian-for-kindle](https://github.com/mhl/guardian-for-kindle). Thanks!

## Building

```bash
go build
```

## Usage

Running the tool with `-h` lists all available options. Enjoy!
